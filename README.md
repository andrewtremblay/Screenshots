Screenshots
===========
"Screenshots" is a really quick fix to the way screenshots are currently treated by native iOS photos, which is poorly. This app scans image metadata in your photos to see which are screnshots and which are not. This also makes it a good place to start if you're interested in [image metadata for iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CGImageProperties_Reference/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005103).
